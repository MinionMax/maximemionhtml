                    <h5>About Me </h5>

                    <h6>Previously on...my life</h6>

                    <p>I've always loved making music and I can't really remember not doing it either... <br>
                       So I haven't stopped since and I've been playing the piano since I was 5 picking up more and more Instruments as I went. <br>
                       In 2015 I appeared on The Voice Kids, advancing to the second round. Proceeding this I started making YouTube videos, covering songs by Ed Sheeran. <br>
                       Through this I learned Video Editing and Music Production, both of which I actively do in my free time. <br>
                       In 2017 I released my first ever project "Holding On EP" which I'm not too fond of, so please don't check it out... <br>
                       I participated in a classical music contest as a duo in 2019 and got to the final stage, where young musicians from all of Germany competed. <br>
                       This is also the year that I started getting into Jazz and experimental music. <br>
                       The following year (2020) I began learning how to code and how to design websites, creating what you're looking at right now.
